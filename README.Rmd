# shinySIR

`shinySIR` provides interactive plotting for mathematical models of infectious disease spread. Users can choose from a variety of common built-in ODE models (such as the SIR, SIRS, and SIS models), or create their own. This latter flexibility allows `shinySIR` to be applied to simple ODEs from any discipline. The package is a useful teaching tool as students can visualize how changing different parameters can impact model dynamics, with minimal knowledge of coding in R. The built-in models are inspired by those featured in the references below [1-4].

###### Recent updates

Version 0.1.3

* Updated documentation for run_shiny() function.
* Removed depreciated dplyr functions.

Version 0.1.2

* Added flexibility in plotting appearance: colour scale can now be customized with the 'values' argument.
* Modified default app title


Version 0.1.1

* Added flexibility in plotting appearance: axis labels and legend titles can now be customized using the following arguments: `xlabel`, `ylabel`, and `legend_title`.
* Includes deSolve error messages if equation solving fails


## Quick start example

The package can be installed from CRAN by running

```{r install0, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("shinySIR")

```

To install the most recent version from Github, first install and load `devtools`, then install `shinySIR` as follows

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")

install_github("SineadMorris/shinySIR")

```


To create an interactive plot of the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model simply load the package and use the `run_shiny()` command. A window, similar to the one below, will appear. This shows the dynamics of the SIR model at the default parameter starting values; you can then change these values to explore their impact on model dynamics.

```{r SIR, eval = FALSE}
library(shinySIR)

run_shiny(model = "SIR")

```

### Built-in models

A number of common models are supplied with the package. These include the SIR, SIRS, and SIS models. These can be accessed using the `model` argument, as shown above for the SIR model. The built-in models are parameterized using $R_0$ and the infectious period ($1/\gamma$), since these may be more intuitive for new students than the slightly abstract transmission rate ($\beta$) and recovery rate ($\gamma$). The values for $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are calculated from the other parameters and printed in a table below the graph (as shown in the SIR example above). 

 A comprehensive description of all built-in models and default parameters are given in the package vignette. Brief information can also be obtained by calling `default_models()`.
 
### User-defined models

Users can also specify their own models using the `neweqns` argument. `neweqns` takes a function containing the equations for the new model, with syntax as outlined in the example below. Note the syntax follows that used by the popular ODE solver `deSolve`.


```{r mymodel, eval = FALSE}
mySIRS <- function(t, y, parms) {

    with(as.list(c(y, parms)),{

        # Change in Susceptibles
        dS <- - beta * S * I + delta * R

        # Change in Infecteds
        dI <- beta * S * I - gamma * I

        # Change in Recovereds
        dR <- gamma * I - delta * R

    return(list(c(dS, dI, dR)))
    })
}

```

The interactive plot can then be created by calling this function with `neweqns`, specifying initial conditions for all model variables (`ics`), and specifying vectors for the parameter attributes, including parameter starting values (`parm0`), names to be displayed in the interactive menu (`parm_names`), and minimum and maximum values for the interactive menu (`parm_min` and `parm_max`, respectively).

```{r mymodel_run, eval = FALSE}

run_shiny(model = "SIRS (w/out demography)", 
          neweqns = mySIRS,
          ics = c(S = 9999, I = 1, R = 0),
          parm0 = c(beta = 5e-5, gamma = 1/7, delta = 0.1),
          parm_names = c("Transmission rate", "Recovery rate", "Loss of immunity"),
          parm_min = c(beta = 1e-5, gamma = 1/21, delta = 1/365),
          parm_max = c(beta = 9e-5, gamma = 1 , delta = 1))

```
